### Assembly Code Repository

#### CompleteNumber.asm:
This assembly program identifies whether a given input number is a perfect number, indicating "Perfect" if it meets the criteria or "Nope" otherwise. Additionally, it displays all divisors of the input number in ascending order, separated by spaces.

#### DigitAddEO.asm:
This assembly code calculates the sum of the odd and even digits of an input number. It then prints these sums in a single line, separated by a space.

#### GCC.asm:
This assembly program computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two input numbers using Euclid's algorithm. It then prints the resulting GCD without any additional characters.

#### LFC.asm:
This assembly program determines the least common multiple (LCM) of two input numbers and prints the result. It ensures that there are no additional characters present in the output.

#### Prime.asm:
This assembly program checks whether a given input number is a prime number. If the number is prime, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". The solution is case-sensitive and ensures no additional characters are printed.

#### QuickSort.asm:
This assembly program implements the Quick Sort algorithm recursively to sort an array of integers. It takes an array of length \( n \) as input, where \( 0 \leq n \leq 10^6 \), and prints the sorted array. The algorithm employs stack for parameter passing.

#### BinarySearch.asm:
This assembly program utilizes the Binary Search algorithm to find the smallest index of a given query in a sorted array. It handles multiple queries and prints the corresponding index or "NaN" if the query is not found. The implementation is recursive, and parameters are passed using stack.
